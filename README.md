# Aman Pratap
My journey to improve my logic thinking following the directions of Love Babar to maintain Git profile and Codeforces profile. 
My On-Campus Placements starts from July 2021 right now I am in my 5th Semester. I am pursuitng B.Tech in Information technology from Academy of Technology,Adisaptagram. 
All kind of sevice based companies visit our college and placement record is also good but not a single product based companies come so Off-Campus is the only route to take. 
Three main goals of mine this year would be building a strong resume and improving my coding and logical thinking ability. 

For strong Resume I thing main focuses would be-: 

1.TECHNICAL SKILLS   2.ONLINE PRESENCE (CODEFORCES / CODECHEF PROFILES)  3.STRONG PROJECTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGIES  4.INTERNSHIPS 

So lets see how much can I accomplish my goals. 
IF YOU ARE READING THIS
WISH ME LUCK!!!

Edit 1-
Today is 10 May 2021, right now I am in 6th semester I did'nt crack the Infosys Exam because I did'nt prepared for it. 
Next is Codevita in August still I have 3 months in hands this time I can't repeat same mistakes. I am hoping to continue studying everyday and follow the routine.

Edit 2:-
Today is 25 July 2021, today is persistent system exam still i am not prepared well enough for the exam. Starting from August Cognizant Interview will start I have strong hope in that but still I have to prepare for that. And there are two NQTs one for special 2022 Ninga Hiring and other normal one so both of them are from 30 August onwards so there is now just one month left right I Have studied aptitude section but just the theory and some practice questions which is definetly not enough to crack NQT I think. Also this time Codevita will happen I think in October so that is also one strong hope to crack TCS but that i have to daily solve atleast 2 questions, but that too i am not able to do. I am very confused or i don't know what's happening with me but my mind dosen't work the right way means i just can't able to focus I know all my cons and shortcommings but still i can't focus on them or improve it. Man its really hard can't focus on anything seriously sometimes my heart bet goes up and it feels like my mind is going to blast or something and whenever that happen my entire day is wasted, literaly sometimes i cry by myself means you konw where you are weak and wht you have to do but still can't do anything about it.

To be honest I have lost faith man in anything i say or think i can do everyday i think think think, that's all i do, maybe this overthinking will kill me one day, 
I don't know how to say it, But I lost my Dad last year 2020 due to covid you know when he was alive I always used to think about my studies only no presuure at all, my plan was simple at that time. My mom and dad has done lot of sacrfices and hard work to give me quality and higer education so in my mind seeing all of this I dream of getting good job and take care of them rest of life. You konw you should know the inspriring story about my parents, my mom and dad comes from very small village in West-bengal, my dad ran from home at very small age ( around 9-10 years i think) to work in city, from the very small age he has been working daily without any breaks to get out of poverty of his family at that time was so talented that without any proper education ( he only studied upto class 6 or 7) he got the position of maneger of an entire branch of one of big company in Patna. 
And seeing all those big officers in the industry he dreamed that one his child(me) will also become this big and have same respect as them. He gave me all the best availabel things at time was detrmined to educate me so in way I was the first on the village to get higer education this far. I am proud of my dad, ya we have some fights in his lifetime but believe me I loved him the most. 
I don't know man maybe the pressure of geting a job or sadness losing him or anything else man i don't know yaar its just hard man. Okay lets see where my life takes me I am trying man seeing my mom working hard everyday i am trying to work. Stay well stay happy.
